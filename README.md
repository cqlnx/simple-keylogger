# simple-keylogger
# DON'T USE THIS ON ANYBODY
This is just a simple keylogger that uses a discord webhook.<br> 
To try this out just replace the part that is in "webhook_url = 'your webhook goes here' whit your actual webhook.<br> 
This was made for educational purposes and is not meant to be used on anybody.<br> 
That's why I won't be responsible for any damage caused by this script if you use it in violation of my terms of service.<br><br>
Also don't use pyinstaller do make this into a exe beacuse that would be bad😉
