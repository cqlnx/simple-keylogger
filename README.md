## What is this?

This is a very simple Python keylogger created as a learning project.  
It captures keyboard input and sends it to a Discord webhook.

The purpose of this project is to:
- Learn how keyboard events work in Python
- Understand how webhooks can transmit data
- Demonstrate why keyloggers are dangerous when misused

---

## How to test it (your own system only)

To test this script only on your own computer:

1. run pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Create a Discord webhook  
3. Open the Python script  
4. Replace the webhook placeholder  
   webhook_url = "your webhook goes here"  
5. Run the script locally  

No additional setup is required.

## What NOT to do

- Do not use this on anyone else  
- Do not install it on computers you don’t own  
- Do not hide or distribute this script  
- Do not compile it into an executable (for example using PyInstaller)  

Turning this into an executable or disguising it would be malicious behavior.

## Educational intent

This project exists to:
- Show how easily keystrokes can be intercepted  
- Encourage ethical and responsible programming  
- Help people recognize and understand malicious software  

If you are learning cybersecurity, treat this as a demonstration, not a weapon.
